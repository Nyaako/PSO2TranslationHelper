This project is intended to aid translators to the game Phantasy Star Online 2.

I would very much appriciate any PR's, Requests or general direction on how to improve this program!

Usage: 
1) You must have a locally cloned repository of the EN branch from https://github.com/Arks-Layer/PSO2ENPatchCSV/tree/EN
   and select this folder in the program. (In the future, this will probably be 10x easier to the point no user interaction is required)

Todo:
-  Manage updates/additions/removal to the database rather than requiring a rebuild each update.
-  Backend work for more parameters to editors (such as {l} for line number etc) 
-  General UI Designing/Front End work.
